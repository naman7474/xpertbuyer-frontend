User Journey Overview
1. Landing & Query: The user lands on the platform and is prompted to enter a natural-language
query describing their skincare goal or concern (e.g. “I want glowing skin”). Upon submission, the
query is sent to an AI-powered backend service that interprets the intent and fetches relevant
data (key ingredients and top product recommendations).
2. AI-Generated Itinerary (Results Page): The platform presents an itinerary-like results page
tailored to the query. This page highlights key ingredients related to the user’s concern and
displays top recommended products (e.g. four product cards) that align with the query. It feels
like a guided plan for the user’s skincare goal, much as Mindtrip provides a plan for a travel
query. Users can scroll through this content-rich page to review suggestions.
3. Interactive Comparison: The results page includes a “Compare” option. When activated, a
comparison view (inspired by Mindtrip’s map toggle) opens to show a side-by-side comparison
table of the recommended products. This lets users easily see ingredient overlap, unique
differentiators, prices, and ratings at a glance 1
. The user can toggle back to the main itinerary
view after comparing.
4. Product Details (PDP) Overlay: If the user clicks on any product card, a Product Detail Page
overlay appears (similar to Mindtrip’s detail modal). This overlay provides full product
information – detailed description, full ingredient list with benefits, influencer “video
commentary” (embedded YouTube videos where the product is mentioned), user ratings/reviews
if available, and a prominent “Buy Now” button linking to the product’s purchase page. The user
can close this overlay to return to the itinerary results.
5. Exploration: The interface also offers an Explore feature (accessible via a top navigation link or
a call-to-action on the results page). The Explore page helps users discover other categories or
ingredients – for example, browsing by skincare concerns (acne, anti-aging, etc.) or by key
ingredients (Vitamin C, Retinol, etc.). From the Explore page, users can initiate new queries or
view curated recommendations for those topics, looping them into another itinerary-like results
page.
6. Continuous Journey: At any point, the user can refine their search (enter a new query or adjust
filters) to get a new AI-generated plan, or use navigation links (like Home or Explore) to move
through the platform. Throughout the journey, all components work together to provide trust
(through social proof content), variety (multiple options and comparisons), and depth of
information (ingredients, usage, reviews) in a coherent flow from initial query to deeper
exploration.
